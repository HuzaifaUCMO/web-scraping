**Course**: Web Mining and Applied NLP (44-620)  
**Student**: Huzaifa Nadeem  
**GitHub Repo**: [View Repository](https://github.com/HuzaifaUCMO/web-scraping)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) in Python using:

- `requests` for fetching web content
- `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML
- `spaCy` for NLP tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging
- `matplotlib` for data visualization

The scraped article is analyzed to find the most frequent tokens and lemmas, and sentences are scored based on their relevance to those words.
